<h1> Path of least resistance <h1>
<p> The path of least resistance is the physical or metaphorical pathway that provides the least resistance to forward motion by a given object or entity, among a set of alternative paths. The concept is often used to describe why an object or entity takes a given path.</p>

<h2> Why does current follow the path of least resistance in a parallel circuit? <h2>
<p> In a parallel connection voltage remains same and current divides which is proportional to the resistance. Hence if one of the resistance is zero then current is travelling through the less resistance path.</p>

<h3> How does electricity find the path of least resistance? <h3>
<p> On average electricity follows the path of least resistance. Passing through regions that have more resistance uses more energy. ... Because of this the electrons flow from high energy locations to low energy locations. When things have more unbound energy they are more likely to expend energy.</p>
