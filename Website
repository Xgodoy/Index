<h1 style="color:blue;">Path of least resistance</h1>
<p> The path of least resistance is the physical or metaphorical pathway that provides the least resistance to forward motion by a given object or entity, among a set of alternative paths. The concept is often used to describe why an object or entity takes a given path.</p>

<h2> Why does current follow the path of least resistance in a parallel circuit? <h2>
<p> In a parallel connection voltage remains same and current divides which is proportional to the resistance. Hence if one of the resistance is zero then current is travelling through the less resistance path.</p>

<h3> How does electricity find the path of least resistance? <h3>
<p style="color:red;">On average electricity follows the path of least resistance. Passing through regions that have more resistance uses more energy. ... Because of this the electrons flow from high energy locations to low energy locations. When things have more unbound energy they are more likely to expend energy.</p>

 <p> You don’t rise to the level of your goals, but fall to the level of your systems” — a quote that well captures the idea that motivation and desires are ineffective at delivering results if they are fighting the underlying systems that run our every day lives. James Clear writes in his book “Atomic Habits” how important it is to influence and curate these systems in order to change the direction of your work and life. Almost two and half decades before James Clear, this concept was brilliantly articulated by Robert Fritz wrote in his thought provoking book “The Path of Least Resistance”.</P>
