<h1> Path of least resistance <h1>
<p> The path of least resistance is the physical or metaphorical pathway that provides the least resistance to forward motion by a given object or entity, among a set of alternative paths. The concept is often used to describe why an object or entity takes a given path.</p>

<h1> Why does current follow the path of least resistance in a parallel circuit? <h1>
<p> In a parallel connection voltage remains same and current divides which is proportional to the resistance. Hence if one of the resistance is zero then current is travelling through the less resistance path.</p>
